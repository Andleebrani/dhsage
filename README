# dhsage R Package

## Overview
The dhsage R package is designed to analyze age heaping in demographic and health surveys. It provides functions to calculate the Whipple index, a measure of age heaping, for a given dataset. The package includes data from 70 waves of demographic and health surveys across 19 Asian countries.

## Usage
To use this package, follow these steps:

 **Installation**: Install the package from CRAN using the following command in R:
   
install.packages("dhsage")

Loading the Package: Load the package into your R session:

library(dhsage)

Loading Data: Load the age data for a specific country and year. For example, to load the age data for Afghanistan in 2010, use the following command:

  x <- afgan_2010

Calculating Whipple Index: Calculate the Whipple index to evaluate age heaping within a specified age range. For example, to calculate the Whipple index for ages 23 to 62:

heaping(x, 23, 62)

Interpreting Results: The output will provide the Whipple index value and the quality of age data according to United Nations standards.
